Cipher Master is a game that teaches players classic ciphers like Caesar, Atbash, Vigenère, and Morse Code through an exciting storyline. The objective is to save WWDC by solving ciphers and helping Steve Jobs' assistant.


I wanted to create a fun and interactive game that also teaches players about common ciphers. The game has four levels, designed to make players feel like they’re part of a  movie. Throughout the game, they’ll send files, solve Morse code puzzles, write terminal commands, and find Wi-Fi passwords. At the end, they receive a special prize—a certificate and a 3D trophy for completing the mission.
The entire game is set inside a Mac-like interface, and players are guided by Steve Jobs’ assistant, who helps them through each challenge.


Used frameworks:
* SwiftUI – Used to build Mac like interface.
* AVFoundation – Used to add sound effects and create the Morse code translator in Level 2.
* SceneKit – Used to make a 3D trophy as a final prize.
